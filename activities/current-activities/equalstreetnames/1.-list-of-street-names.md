# 1. List of street names

## Step 1: Create a local repository for your city 

Ask a technical lead to fork the project from [here](https://github.com/openknowledgebe/equalstreetnames/blob/master/docs/replicate.md). If you don’t have a technical lead, please email [equalstreetnames@openknowledge.be](mailto:equalstreetnames@openknowledge.be) and we will do our best to help you.

## Step 2: Generate a list of the street names in your city

In order to know how many streets you’ll be working on, you need to do a query on [http://overpass-turbo.eu/](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) and export it as .CSV.

**The query can be found** [**here**](http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/129j) **or as followed:**

```text
[out:csv(::type, ::id, name, "name:fr", "name:nl", wikidata, "name:etymology:wikidata")][timeout:120];

// Mons: Code INS 53053
( area["admin_level"="8"]["ref:INS"="53053"]; )->.a;

(
  way["highway"]["name"]["highway"!="bus_stop"]["highway"!="service"](area.a);
  relation["type"="associatedStreet"](area.a);
  relation["type"="multipolygon"]["place"]["name"](area.a);
  relation["type"="multipolygon"]["highway"]["name"](area.a);
);

out body;
```

**Explanation:** 

* INS"="53053: Statistic code used for Belgium. This code will differ abroad. 
* Way\["highway"\]\["name"\]\["highway"!="bus\_stop"\]\["highway"!="service" : asking the street names expect from buses or services \(example: a very small way used privately for a garage\)
* Relation: Attention, you need to query for both ways & relations as it’s two different ways to record streets in OpenStreetMaps.

**Once this is done:** 

* Export the document in .CSV 
* Delete all the doubles. OpenStreetMap streets are sometimes recorded into different ways \(different fractions of the streets\), meaning that it can appear multiple times on your CSV document.
