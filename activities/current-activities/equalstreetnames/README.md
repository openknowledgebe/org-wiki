# EqualStreetNames

The names of public spaces \(streets, avenues, squares and others\) define the identity of a city and how citizens interact with it. Many cities around the world suffer from a major inequality between male and female street names and we want to help fix this. 

There are several ways to approach the inequality of street names and leverage a positive change in our society. Ours is with the use of Open Data to create a **map visualizing the streetnames of Brussels by gender.**

## **How did we make this map?**

To make this happen, we used [open data](http://opendefinition.org/) - data which can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose - from [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/) and [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). 

**The ultimate goal is to link the data from Wikidata \(the database of Wikipedia\) to OpenStreetMap. This is clearly explained in the subpages** 

## Technical VS Non-technical? We've got you covered!

**If you're technical,** please refer to our repository on Github: [https://github.com/openknowledgebe/equalstreetnames](https://github.com/openknowledgebe/equalstreetnames), where the process is clearly documented.

**If you're non-technical,** here's your **"How to start EqualStreetNames in my City".** 

Let's get started! ðŸš€
